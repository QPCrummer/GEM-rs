  <summary><h2 style="display: inline-block" id="requirements">Requirements</h2></summary>
  
- The standard Rust tooling (cargo, rustup) which you can install from https://rustup.rs/

- Toolchain support for the cortex-m0+ processors in the rp2040 (thumbv6m-none-eabi)

- flip-link - this allows you to detect stack-overflows on the first core, which is the only supported target for now.

- An embedded system with at least 120KB of memory

<!-- Features -->

  <summary><h2 style="display: inline-block" id="features">Features</h2></summary>

  There are several [feature flags in rp2040-hal](https://docs.rs/rp2040-hal/latest/rp2040_hal/#crate-features).
  If you want to enable some of them, uncomment the `rp2040-hal` dependency in `Cargo.toml` and add the
  desired feature flags there. For example, to enable ROM functions for f64 math using the feature `rom-v2-intrinsics`:
  ```
  rp2040-hal = { version="0.10", features=["rt", "critical-section-impl", "rom-v2-intrinsics"] }
  ```
